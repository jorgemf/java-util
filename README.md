===========

set of utilities in java, data structures, parallel runtime & search algorithms  *(under construction)*
-----------

- data structures:
  - trie
  - b-star (memory based)
  - octree + basic intersection shapes
- search algorithms
  - a-star (normal and parallel version)
  - genetic algorithm (normal and parallel version)
  - genetic programming
  - nsga-II
  - simulated anealing
- parallel runtime
  - run tasks in parallel (thread pool) 
  - blackboard agents
  - events


other ideas for the future:
---------

- statistical package (something similar to R)
- graph visualization (at least integration with gnuplot or something similar)
- clients-service arquitecture (with master)
- map reduce with network comunication (using previous arquitecture), flume or cloud dataflow for small clusters
